# What is Kubernetes and for what purposes it used?

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that enables the operation of an elastic web server framework for cloud applications. 
Kubernetes can support data center outsourcing to public cloud service providers or can be used for web hosting at scale.
Website and mobile applications with complex custom code can deploy using Kubernetes on commodity hardware to lower the costs on web server provisioning with public cloud hosts and to optimize software development processes.
